This is a Hardhat project with several simple contracts tests implemented.

- Uses Husky for pre-commit checks.
- Uses GTS for TypeScript formatting and linting.
- Uses OpenZeppelin contracts as a base.
- Uses Solhint for Solidity linting.
- Uses Hardhat+Solidity for Solidity formatting.

## ERC1820
